The assignment is to train a NN from scratch. Creating a simple network to show different steps of training including back propagation.
This excels sheet take us through step by step forward propagation and back propagation steps of the network.

Assumptions:
- Two Input neurons (i1, i2)
- One hidden layer of size 2 (h1, h2)
- Activation function on hidden layers (out_h1, out_h2)
- One output layer (O1, O2)
- Activation Function on Output (out_O1, out_O2)
- Target (t1, t2)
- Error Total (Total = E1 + E2)
- Weights (w1,w2 ………, w8)
