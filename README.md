### **Project** ERA V2 Session 5
#### Instructions
##### Re-look at the code that we worked on in Assignment 4 (the fixed version). 
Move the contents of the code to the following files:

    * model.py
    
    * utils.py
    
    * S5.ipynb
    
    * Make the whole code run again. 
    
    * Upload the code with the 4 files + README.md file to GitHub. README.md (look at the spelling) must have details about this code and how to read your code (what file does what). Heavy negative scores for not 
      formatting your markdown file into p, H1, H2, list, etc. 

* Datasets: MNIST Digits dataset
* Purpose: Create a simple CNN using PyTorch
